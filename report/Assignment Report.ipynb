    "#### Fairness of the Current Formula:\n",
    "The current loyalty point formula is designed to encourage player activity on the platform by rewarding deposits, withdrawals, and the number of games played. While the formula has its strengths, it also has some potential drawbacks in terms of fairness.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Current Formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Loyalty Point = (0.01 * deposit) + (0.005 * Withdrawal amount) + (0.001 * (maximum of (#deposit - #withdrawal) or 0)) + (0.2 * Number of games played)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encourages players to be consistently active.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rewards players for both their financial transactions and gameplay.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It tends to favor players who make large deposits, which could lead to inequality among players.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The penalty for withdrawals might discourage players from cashing out their winnings, which could be seen as unfair.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Suggested Improvements:\n",
    "##### Equal Points for Deposits and Withdrawals:\n",
    "\n",
    "Deposit Points: 0.01 × Deposit Amount\n",
    "\n",
    "Withdrawal Points: 0.01 × Withdrawal Amount\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Add New Factors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Loyalty Points: Existing Formula + (0.01 × Number of Days Active)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Cap Points from Deposits:\n",
    "\n",
    "Deposit Points: min(0.01 × Deposit Amount, 100)\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Balanced Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensuring both financial transactions and gameplay are equally rewarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggested Formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Loyalty Points =\n",
    "##### (0.01 × Deposit) + (0.01 × Withdrawal Amount) + (0.001 × max(# deposits - # withdrawals, 0)) + (0.15 × Number of Games Played) + (0.01 × Number of Days Active)"

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, the loyalty point system implemented by ABC effectively encourages player activity by rewarding financial transactions and gameplay. However, the current formula has some areas that could be improved to ensure greater fairness among players.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary of Findings:**\n",
    "- The loyalty points are calculated based on deposits, withdrawals, the number of games played, and the difference between deposits and withdrawals.\n",
    "- Specific slots and overall calculations for October were performed to identify top players.\n",
    "- Average deposit amounts and game activities were analyzed to provide insights into player behavior.\n",
    "- Bonus allocation was suggested based on the total loyalty points earned by players.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations:**\n",
    "- Adjust the loyalty point formula to give equal weightage to deposits and withdrawals.\n",
    "- Introduce additional factors such as duration of membership and activity frequency to reward long-term loyal players.\n",
    "- Implement a cap on points from deposits to prevent disproportionate rewards.\n",
    "- Balance the weightage for financial transactions and gameplay to ensure fairness."
